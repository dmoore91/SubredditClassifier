That its not our place to pass judgement on our fellow man. Yet, here you are, passing judgement on others because they don't risk their job or lives to do what you want them to do. \n\nAnd people do bad shit. Welcome to earth 101 space cadet. You cannot control the actions of others. You can stand up and help when you have the strength. You can ease the suffering of another wherever you can. But you cannot control others. As well, yeah, their actions are sick and evil. That isn't actually doing anything. I can say I'm going to clean my car, but that's not fixing it. That's not undoing the damage. And quite frankly, I didn't hurt them. I don't belong to a church because that was more damaging to my faith. I can gladly bash the churches with them because those churches are widely visited by those who take the lords name in vain.\n\nYet, I'm not helping them get better. I'm just comiserating with them about how awful the church is. Y'know what Jesus would say? Show him the love and compassion you've felt from God in your actions. God didn't sit down and whine with me. He helped by making the burden easier to bear by blessing me with the good fortune to meet some of the best people in the world. So why would I just sit and state the obvious? What would that do besides Jack shit? I know that you really don't know the faith that well, especially since you're using Paul, one of the many reasons people take issue with the fucking bible because he contradicts Jesus so fuckin often, but you really don't even know Gospel. \n\nYou're judging me for not blindly trumpeting what I do, because I'm not making a scene about it. Jesus said that when you give to charity, do it in secrecy, so that your left hand doesn't know your right hand did anything. Be humble in your charity, and don't be charitable for recognition. That's two things that Jesus wasn't about, at all. Yet you want to act like you're a good Christian because you want to allow people to denigrate you, your friends, and your family. Sorry, but no. I'm an imperfect being, and I care too much about the people I choose to let into my life to let someone whose unable to process their own emotions shit on them because \"well maybe they were abused by the church\". I was abused by a black kid growing up, but I'm not out here saying \"all blacks are criminals\". \n\nAnd I'll be kind all day to people. I usually am. But their baggage isn't my problem. I have my own shit. I have a mountain of baggage that I don't use to justify treating people like shit,  because I'm not 14 anymore. So why is it my responsibility to take on other's baggage? What if they're just a twat who hates religion because they think that humans are logical machines and that is all that matters? Or they read a book, decided that book was the only thing worth reading, and is just an ignorant child who doesn't know anything except what smarter people tell them? Or what if they're someone who claims to follow Jesus, but then doesn't actually know what Jesus said, and even quotes Paul? When Jesus hung out with thieves, whores, and tax collectors? Jesus only went off on people who were ignorant in their faith, or used faith as a shield of their actions. He called people out. He forgave them as well, but forgiveness and being a door mat are two different things. \n\nLearn your gospel before speaking to me as if you're an authority. And don't you dare quote Paul at anyone ever again, that dude was a piece of work who used his faith to shield himself from the repercussions of his previous life and barely followed Jesus.", "created_utc": 1575865191.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "fa98ejw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e7o4th", "parent_id": "t1_fa8ftmk", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e7o4th/like_please_stop_just_stop/fa98ejw/", "replies": null, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "Yes, I know Tartini wasn't the fiddle-playing hillbilly of \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\".
