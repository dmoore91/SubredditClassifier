Not believing isn't going to stop it. I already gave up on churches, so they're not getting my money, so what should I do besides be a miserable sod who whinges about injustice that I can't stop? Vote for non religious leaders? Already voting based on their competence anyway. \n\nSo either give me a solution where I can still feed myself and house myself, or shut up.

But no, he doesn't just throw them at people who \"worship\" him. God throws this lifevest to everyone, and what people need to do to not drown is to grab the vest and trust that if they follow God's instructions, then He will pull them to safety. This is what it means to be a Christian: acknowledging God's existence, admitting that you need to be saved, accepting the offer of the lifevest by grabbing it, and trusting and following God's instructions so He can pull you to safety. If you do that, then you won't drown and God has forgiven your sins.\n\nAs for the other issue of whether small-time bad behaviour is deserving of eternal separation of God, you can think of it this way: a dark blue stain and a blue stain look quite different on a black dress as you won't mind the dark blue stain as much on the black backdrop. But on a white dress, a dark blue and a blue stain are equally unacceptable. This is why I said that God was \"completely\" righteous. We are sinners, and we make excuses for other small sins so we can get away with them ourselves. But God's complete righteousness would prevent us from being with him, just as you won't willingly associate yourself with murderers and rapists.\n\nThis is why Jesus was so special: His coming into this world as a human, His willing association with sinners and social outcasts, and His sacrifice for us all demonstrate the kind of unconditional love God has for us so we can trust Him and grab the lifevest.

I find Christianity and my church (Anglican) to be very based I guess I'd say. We don't come across as uber spiritual and supernatural, like God putting bread in bibles and stuff.\n\nWe only follow the bible, as the bible says Proverbs 30:5-6 ESV \nEvery word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.\n\nThere are other such verses, so through them alone you can remove any biblical religion that follows additional text, Mormons, Catholics etc. And the views of both further contradict easily understood biblical teachings. The splintering of interpretation is indeed troubling I agree, but the reliability of the translations is great as history proves so we do have what we need to find the truth. \n\nThis is how I see it. If God is real and as he is in the bible, then he has to of made every effort to be known to be an all loving God. Furthermore he should make sense, and I mean rational and logical sense. I honestly believe Christianity as a world view requires less faith than all others, including athiesm. Yes there are some things that aren't fully explainable or 100% understandable, but we're talking about God here, for us humans to dictate to him how he should explain himself to us is profoundly arrogant when he has given us more than enough to find him and feel fully confident in following him.", "created_utc": 1575846230.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1575853024.0, "id": "fa8hb4t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e7sr1o", "parent_id": "t1_fa8d60z", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e7sr1o/whats_eastern_orthodoxy_all_about/fa8hb4t/", "replies": null, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "Easter is more important. #CatholicsAreAlwaysRight", "created_utc": 1575843723.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "fa8b0f5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e7wnej", "parent_id": "t3_e7wnej", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e7wnej/e_a_s_t_e_r/fa8b0f5/", "replies": null, "score": 4, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "\"God strike me down if-\"\n\n# ZZZAP!", "created_utc": 1575848767.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "fa8l514", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e7ul8v", "parent_id": "t3_e7ul8v", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e7ul8v/lord_have_mercy/fa8l514/", "replies": null, "score": 12, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "Ditto, brother.", "created_utc": 1575842550.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "fa880k4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e7o4th", "parent_id": "t1_fa753s6", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e7o4th/like_please_stop_just_stop/fa880k4/", "replies": null, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "Couldn't remembeeeer, oh, the greatest song in the wo-o-o-oorld", "created_utc": 1575888921.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "fa9s11u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e815qu", "parent_id": "t1_fa9fyfg", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e815qu/_/fa9s11u/", "replies": null, "score": 43, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "Dank", "created_utc": 1575859763.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "fa9162s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e82xpl", "parent_id": "t3_e82xpl", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e82xpl/galatians_416/fa9162s/", "replies": null, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "[visible confusion]", "created_utc": 1575858992.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "fa9040i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e7vhy3", "parent_id": "t1_fa8u4rc", "permalink": "/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/e7vhy3/welcome_to_church/fa9040i/", "replies": null, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "submission": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_37bil"}, {"body": "This is a reference to a famous sketch by Rowan Atkinson y'all.
