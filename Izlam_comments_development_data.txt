Who WOULDN'T be against their country changing demography like that?\n\nConsidering that I don't give any importance to skin color, I don't see the problem in that. Again, skin color doesn't have value. It doesn't indicate IQ either. Skin color is not on the same genes as IQ. enivronment and education play a role in IQ. So if you want a higher IQ encourage better education. The american education system is a joke.\n\nI would panic if half people of a country start supporting kim jong un tomorrow. That would be worrying. Not changing in colors. And if you don't want it to change then have more kids. You have the right for that, even though I think it's not worth your time.\n\nAnd avoid identity politics completely if you can. You have seen how bad it is.\n\n>I guess you're with me then.\n\nI'm with you in the sense that anti-white discrimination needs to stop.
