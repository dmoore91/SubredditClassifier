And, what exactly is morality or ethics anyway? I don't pay attention. Something is either legal or it isn't. I don't know what these words mean: good, bad, wrong, right, moral, immoral, unethical.\n\n>Not particularly. In fact, there's a lot of room for my improvement.\n\nOkay. So you are a moral relativist. Well, I disagree with you. I'm no longer a muslim, I'm an atheist. I'm a moral realist. There are better ways to reach wellbeing and lower suffering. we have to find these ways. And I'm confident that no religion has to get its ways to politics, islam, christianity or judaism or any woohoo.\n\nObejctively you won't find morality written in quantum physics, evolution or germ theory. These are means to explain things. Evolution explains hkw we get our morals. In the past people lived in tribes. Then religions like christianity and islam came over and created super-tribes. But the process wasn't very succrssful. But overall people shared ideas and laws to reach wellbeing. But their ways and laws were wrong. We know that. What now has to begin is to share new values. New morals, based on science, to reach well-being. Obviously, \"natural selection\" isn't the way to go and doesn't excuse harm or genocide.\n\nAnd these values need to be shared : secularism, woman rights, equality for all races, equality in the legal system.\n\nSo here's the picture. My view of morality and what we should do.\n\n>We don't even know who killed JFK. How do we have the slightest idea of what happened 2000 years ago when may 0.00069% of people could even read or write?\n\nI agree. But how many white people were in Israel at the time. Not much.\n\n>If you could reason with religious people, there wouldn't be any religious people.\n\nI agree. But they allready hold cognitive dissonance and religions are dying. Christianity is dying and islam will die faster and faster.\n\n>Next question?\n\nYes. I don't understand what you want, nor what you believe in, nor the reason why you chose race for your name. My first guess was that you are a white nationalist or a white supremacist. But at this point I'm confused. If you chose that name to challenge anti-white bigotry from sjws then I'm with you.
